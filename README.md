Overview of the Project

project:  FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) DESIGN

Define FSM Requirements:
Determine the behavior or control logic that the FSM needs to model.
Define states, inputs, outputs, and transitions of the FSM.
VHDL Implementation:

Implement the FSM using VHDL:
Define states as enumerations or signals.
Implement state transitions using combinational or sequential logic.

State Diagram Representation:
Create a state diagram that visually represents the states and transitions of the FSM.

Testbench Development:
Write VHDL testbenches to simulate different scenarios of inputs and verify the expected outputs.
Test different state transitions and boundary conditions to ensure robustness.

Simulation and Verification:
Simulate the FSM behavior using the VLSI software environment 
Verify the correctness of the FSM behavior against expected results from the testbenches.

Debugging and Iteration:
Debug any issues that arise during simulation.
Modify the VHDL code as necessary to fix bugs or enhance functionality based on simulation results.

Documentation:
Document the design process, including FSM specifications, VHDL code, testbenches, and simulation results.
Provide a summary of the FSM's functionality and how it meets the initial requirements.
